## Project

Our project is called Rezoom. Rezoom is a web application that allows users to upload their resume and have it reviewed by peers in their industry. Users can rate and comment other resumes and recieve tips on how to improve their own resume. Rezoom requires that a user must have already reviewed a resume from someone in their industry before they will receive feedback. We home Rezoom will help all job seekers land their dream job!
